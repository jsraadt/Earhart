\title{Calculate Multiple R-Squared Effect Sizes of an Amelia Object (Multiple Imputation)}
\usage{
mi.mult.r.sqr(data = data, num.imp = num.imp, dv.list = c(NULL),
  num.dv = num.dv, iv.list = c(NULL), num.iv = num.iv,
  num.obs = num.obs, idvars = c(NULL))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with missing data, e.g. <my.data.frame>}

\item{num.imp}{A number representing how many imputations the embeded Amelia function will create, e.g. <20>}

\item{dv.list}{A list of characters to be treated as dependent variables in the Amelia object , e.g. <c("dv1")>, (this package currently only supports a single DV)}

\item{num.dv}{A number representing how many dependent variables are in your desired model, e.g. <1>, (currently restircted to 1, but it is included for future version in which multivariate regression will be supported)}

\item{iv.list}{A list of characters to be treated as independent variables in the Amelia object, e.g. <c("iv1","iv2","iv3"), (must match names of variables from the data.frame in the 'data' argument of this function)}

\item{num.iv}{A number representing how many independent variables in your desired model, e.g. <3>}

\item{num.obs}{A number representing how many observations are in the data set, e.g. <420>, (must match the number of rows in the data.frame in the 'data' argument of this function)}

\item{idvars}{A list of characters to be treated as id variables by the embedded Amelia function, e.g. <c("id","year")}
}
\value{
Spits out a number that represents the Multiple R-Squared effect size of your imputed data set.
