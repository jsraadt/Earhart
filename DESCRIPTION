Description: Earhart uses amelia::amelia and amelia::mi.meld functions to calculate multiple R-Squared effect size of a specified model (currently restricted to 1 dependent variable). Earhart finds the mean of the observation across imputations from the created amelia object, calculate y-hat values from these means and the regression coefficients from mi.meld, calculates the sum-of-squares of y-hat, calculates the sum of squares of y, and  finally calculates the R-squared effect size.
